## How to use the files?

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` for development mode
4. New browser window should open automatically.

## Note

If you are having issues with [pug-html-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pug-html-loader), try to install [pug-loader](https://github.com/pugjs/pug-loader) and change the loader inside of package.json to `use: 'pug-loader'`. That should fix it.

Or simply remove pug template and use pure html.
